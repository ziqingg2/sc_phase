SC Phase is a minimalist computer music composition finished entirely using SuperCollider. 
The core of this composition is an eight-voice cannon with excessive repetitions. 
The synthesis technique which composes most of the sounds is wavetable synthesis: 
I took four of Bach’s Fugues from WTC with their subjects’ position on the staff translated to envelopes (each note is a transient point), 
and then used SuperCollider’s class methods to convert these envelops to wavetables for my synthesis processes. 
The musical components are relatively simple: with four-note groups selecting notes from a Eb Phrygian scale, 
and these short segments were played and repeated by each of the wavetable synthesis unit generators at certain time marks.
The overall form presents an ABA’ structure according the changes in the short motifs (some of them are randomized and shuffled each time they are introduced). 
Lastly, the ambience/backgrounds are done by using granular synthesis unit generators in SuperCollider.
